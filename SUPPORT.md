# Support

## Community support (open core)

Use GitHub for open-core support:

- Bugs: GitHub Issues
- Usage questions: GitHub Discussions
- Feature requests: GitHub Issues with context and example inputs

## Commercial support (future)

Commercial support tiers (SLA, onboarding, advanced diagnostics) are planned but not yet generally available.

## Before filing an issue

Please include:
- `patchwaste` version and platform
- Command used
- Relevant input snippet (sanitized)
- Expected vs actual output
- Any CI logs/error messages
